# Survival_4 Main Branch
Repository for backups of Survival_4 survival world.

Go to a different branch (drop-down menu on the top left) to select the Survival_4 world.

After that, go to Code>Download ZIP to get a zipped file with the world folder inside of it.
(The world folder ITSELF that you use should be in the same folder as a README.md file)
